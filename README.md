PROJECT EXPLANATION
ABOUT PROJECT

The Backend of this assignment is prepared by mostly using the class material of Kevin Felix. I used MySQL in this project.
Some frontend layouts used from https://startbootstrap.com/ . I have created admins with is_admin variable in the users table. But I also used separately an admin panel and configured it like i wanted= https://open-admin.org/docs. OpenAdmin has apart table for it's admins. So I have 2 different table for OpenAdmin and Users(including is_admin variable). To go to OpenAdmin's Login panel; there is a button in User Login page. OpenAdmin login page did not offer chance to edit it and integrate with my User Login page, this is why I built it like this. OpenAdmin gives you chance to edit your database in their dashboard.
Also when I got stuck ofcourse I asked help of ChatGpt and Claude. But they were not that helpful.
Obviously I didn't just use the bootstrap, I modified them as I wished.
